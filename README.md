# Beecrowd Problems - Algorithms and Programming 1

These are some Beecrowd problems I solved during the Algorithms and Programming 1 course. The course was taught entirely in Python, but with a twist... I programmed in Python as if I were programming in C or Java. From the beginning, my professor always said that Python is a language with a function for everything, numerous libraries to solve various different problems, and that if we wanted to be good programmers, we should "program by hand" üíª.

Because of this, it's likely that you'll look at some exercises and notice a simpler way to solve them in Python. However, the logic applied in these exercises would easily allow you to solve the same problem in C üîß.

I hope these problems can somehow help with your studies üìö and assist you in becoming more refined programmers üöÄ.

Thank you for reading this simple text. Good luck with your studies! üçÄ
